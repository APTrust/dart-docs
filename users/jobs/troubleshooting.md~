## Uploading

### SFTP

####

#### Upload failed due to unknown error.

This can occur when your local machine's SSH hosts file does not have the
public key of the sftp server you are connecting to.

You can fix this by manually connecting to the server with

```
local:~ yoozer$ ssh server.example.com
The authenticity of host 'server.example.com (::1)' can't be established.
ED25519 key fingerprint is SHA256:3WxPp9MParT+tsW/LpcNWR1m4c126aWIR98LVyEgfcw.
Are you sure you want to continue connecting (yes/no)? yes
Warning: Permanently added 'localhost' (ED25519) to the list of known hosts.
yoozer@server.example.com's password:
```

You can hit Control-C after the last prompt, since your ssh hosts file now
has the key.
