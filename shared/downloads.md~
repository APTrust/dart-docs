!!! note "Note for Mac Users"
    If you see a message that states it canâ€™t open DART.app because it is from an unidentified developer: Open System Preferences > Security & Privacy and click Open Anyway. APTrust is working on getting an Apple Developer certificate, so this issue should be resolved in a later release.
