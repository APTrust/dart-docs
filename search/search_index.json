Running Jobs The Running Jobs panel shows jobs DART is currently running on your computer. If more than one job is currently running, you can scroll inside the panel to see the progress of each. Also note the blue badge in the upper right corner of the window showing there are two running jobs. The blue badge appears on all DART views as long as jobs are running. Note that DART runs each job in a separate process. Actions you take in DART do not affect the running jobs. Warning When you shut down the DART application, all DART jobs stop, even if they are not yet complete. Don't close the DART window while jobs are running, unless you intend to stop all of the jobs. Progress Bars for Running Jobs The progress bars for running jobs show how much progress DART has made in each of the job's steps, which may include packaging, validation, and/or uploading. Info While the progress bars for packaging and validation are very accurate, the progress bar for uploads runs slightly ahead of the actual upload progress. DART knows how many bytes of an upload it has prepared to send, but not how many have been received by the remote host. It's common for the upload progress bar to appear to stall at about 98% while the last chunk of data goes across the wire. For smaller uploads, the stall may last only a second or two. For very large uploads, the final chunk may be hundreds of megabytes and may take several minutes to complete. Recent Jobs The Recent Jobs panel lists recently completed jobs. The Outcome column shows the job's last completed step, while the Date column shows when that step was completed. You can get more detailed information by clicking Jobs List from the top menu. See also: Jobs Repositories The Repositories panels show items from remote repositories that DART knows how to connect to. In the screenshot above, this panel shows items recently ingested into APTrust's demo repository: The panel below shows a list of pending or recently completed tasks from APTrust demo system. Some repository panels, such as those from APTrust, show additional information when you mouse over an item. The panels show errors if they cannot communicate with the remote repository. If you run into errors like this, chances are your Remote Repository is incorrectly configured. Info Remote repository panels require both a correctly configured Remote Repository setting and a plugin that knows how to communicate with the remote repository.

They are pickup and drop-off points for materials going into or coming out of repositories. Some repositories ask depositors to upload materials into an S3 bucket or an SFTP folder for ingest, and restore materials to a similar bucket or folder for depositors to retrieve. Storage services allow DART to connect to these pickup and drop-off points. Note, however, that you're free to send data to and from these storage services even if they're not ultimately bound for a preservation repository. Listing Storage Services To list all storage services, choose Settings Storage Services from the menu. Editing Storage Services Click any storage servicei in the list to edit it. Description of Settings Name The name of the service. Choose a name that's meaningful to you and that differentiates this service from others. You can change the name at any time without affecting the bevavior or availability of the service. Description A description of this service. Protocol Choose the network protocol used to communicate with this service. Note: At launch, DART supports only the S3 protocol. Host Enter the name or IP address of the service host. Do not include protocol prefixes like https:// or ftp:// . For example, the host name for Amazon's S3 service is s3.amazonaws.com . A locally hosted service may be s3.example.com or ftp.example.com . You can also enter an IP address here such as 127.0.0.1 . Port The port to connect to. In most cases, you'll want to leave this at 0 (zero). Set this only if the service is running on a non-standard port number. Bucket The name of the bucket you'll be uploading into or downloading from on the remote host. For the S3 protocol, this will be a bucket name like aptrust.dart.test . For protocols like FTP and rsync, this will be a directory name like uploads/ingest/ or downloads/restore . Allows Upload Choose Yes if this service allows you to upload files, No otherwise. Info This setting is important. When you run a job, DART gives you a choice of storage services to which to send your files. DART will show only those services where Allows Upload is set to Yes . Allows Download Choose Yes if this service allows you to download files, No otherwise. Info While DART does not support downloads in its initial release, it may support them in a future release. Login Enter your login name for the service. For FTP and rsync services, this will typically be a user name. For S3 services, it will be an access key ID. For S3 services, you may want to keep your access keys in an environment variable. If you choose to do so, you can enter env: followed by the name of the environment variable here and DART will pull the setting from the environment at run time. For example, if you keep your AWS access key id in an environment variable called AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID, then enter env:AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID . Password Enter your password for the service. For FTP and rsync services, this will typically be an actual passowrd. For S3 services, it will be an secret access key. As with the Login field above, you can set this to reference an environment variable using the env: pattern. For example, env:AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY . Login Extra This field is typically not used.
