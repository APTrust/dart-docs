There's no need for a routing engine, or for JavaScript to keep track of navigation history, the state of HTML components on the page, data mappings, a virtual DOM, etc.</p> </li> <li> <p>Each MVC request routes to one endpoint of one controller and the mapping is always obvious from the URL.

This is seen as an evil to be avoided in web applications because a page load requires one or more network calls and causes the user to lose state information and the dynamically loaded content that comes from infinite scrolling. DART does not need to make network calls to load pages, and because it keeps no state, there's nothing to lose.

For example, the <code>Allow-Fetch.txt</code> in GitHub BagIt profiles is called <code>allowFetchTxt</code> in DART profiles. This is in part to simplify JavaScript attributes so they can be reference in dot notation, and in part because the nedb object database used in early versions of DART did not support attribute names containing dots.</p> </li> <li> <p>DART profiles include an <code>id</code> attribute with a UUID. This is used internally, while the bagItProfileIdentifier URL is used externally.</p> </li> <li> <p>DART profiles include the following additional boolean attributes:</p> <ol> <li><code>allowMiscTopLevelFiles</code> which indicates whether files other than        manifests and tag manifests are allowed in the bag's root directory.</li> <li><code>allowMiscDirectories</code> which indicates whether directories other than        /data and its children are allowed in the bag.</li> <li><code>tarDirMustMatchName</code> which indicates whether the name of the        unserialized bag must match the name of the serialized bag, minus        the serialization extension. (That is, whether my_bag.tar must untar        to my_bag, and my_bag.zip must unzip to my_bag.)</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>DART includes the attribute <code>baseProfileId</code> for internal use, to know whether    a user-created profile was based on an existing profile.</p> </li> <li> <p>DART includes the <code>isBuiltIn</code> attribute to indicate that a profile was built    in to the application (usually through a setup module or migration). These    profiles cannot be deleted.</p> </li> <li> <p>DART does not specify <code>tagFilesRequired</code> or <code>tagFilesAllowed</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>DART BagIt profiles specify all tag requirements in a single list called    <code>tags</code> while the GitHub BagIt spec defines them as nested objects with    arbitrary names. The single list of uniform objects in the DART model makes    tag definitions easier to manipulate.</p> </li> <li> <p>While tag definitions in the GitHub BagIt Profile spec include only the    attributes <code>required</code> and <code>values</code>, DART tag definitions include the following    attributes:</p> <ol> <li><code>id</code> - A unique identifier in UUID format that DART uses internally.        This allows users to edit tag definitions in the DART UI without        the system losing track of which tag is being edited. The UUID is        immutable while all other attributes are not.</li> <li><code>tagFile</code> - The name of the tag file that contains the tag. This is        a path relative to the bag root. For example, <code>bag-info.txt</code> or        <code>custom-tags/image-credits.txt</code>.</li> <li><code>tagName</code> - The name of the tag. For example, <code>Source-Organization</code>.</li> <li><code>required</code> - A boolean indicating whether the tag is required.</li> <li><code>values</code> - An option list of legal values. If this list is present        and a tag contains a value that's not in the list, the value and        the bag are invalid.</li> <li><code>defaultValue</code> - A default value assigned by the user to the tag.        DART's BagIt Profile editor allows users to specify default values        to tags that will be consistent across bags. For example, users        can define a default value to <code>Source-Organization</code> so they don't        have to assign it repeatedly every time they create a new bag.</li> <li><code>userValue</code> - The value of a tag to be written into or read from a        tag file. Users can specify a userValue that overrides the        defaultValue when they create a bag. When reading a bag, DART        assigns the actual value of a tag to what was read from the bag.</li> <li><code>isBuiltIn</code> - A boolean value indicating whether a tag definition        is built in (as opposed to user-created). DART's BagIt Profile        editor allows users to add custom tags to a published profile,        such as the APTrust profile, while preventing them from deleting        built-in tag definitions. Deleting a built-in tag definition such        as <code>Source-Organization</code> would lead to DART generating invalid bags.</li> <li><code>help</code> - Help text to describe the significance of the tag to the        user. If present, the DART UI will display this message for the        user's edification and delight.</li> </ol> </li> </ol>"},{"location":"dart2/users/bagit/#built-in-profiles","title":"Built-in Profiles","text":"<p>DART includes the following built-in profiles.

For example, the <code>Allow-Fetch.txt</code> in GitHub BagIt profiles is called <code>allowFetchTxt</code> in DART profiles. This is in part to simplify JavaScript attributes so they can be reference in dot notation, and in part because the nedb object database used in early versions of DART did not support attribute names containing dots.</p> </li> <li> <p>DART profiles include an <code>id</code> attribute with a UUID. This is used internally, while the bagItProfileIdentifier URL is used externally.</p> </li> <li> <p>DART profiles include the following additional boolean attributes:</p> <ol> <li><code>allowMiscTopLevelFiles</code> which indicates whether files other than        manifests and tag manifests are allowed in the bag's root directory.</li> <li><code>allowMiscDirectories</code> which indicates whether directories other than        /data and its children are allowed in the bag.</li> <li><code>tarDirMustMatchName</code> which indicates whether the name of the        unserialized bag must match the name of the serialized bag, minus        the serialization extension. (That is, whether my_bag.tar must untar        to my_bag, and my_bag.zip must unzip to my_bag.)</li> </ol> </li> <li> <p>DART includes the attribute <code>baseProfileId</code> for internal use, to know whether    a user-created profile was based on an existing profile.</p> </li> <li> <p>DART includes the <code>isBuiltIn</code> attribute to indicate that a profile was built    in to the application (usually through a setup module or migration). These    profiles cannot be deleted.</p> </li> <li> <p>DART does not specify <code>tagFilesRequired</code> or <code>tagFilesAllowed</code>.</p> </li> <li> <p>DART BagIt profiles specify all tag requirements in a single list called    <code>tags</code> while the GitHub BagIt spec defines them as nested objects with    arbitrary names. The single list of uniform objects in the DART model makes    tag definitions easier to manipulate.</p> </li> <li> <p>While tag definitions in the GitHub BagIt Profile spec include only the    attributes <code>required</code> and <code>values</code>, DART tag definitions include the following    attributes:</p> <ol> <li><code>id</code> - A unique identifier in UUID format that DART uses internally.        This allows users to edit tag definitions in the DART UI without        the system losing track of which tag is being edited. The UUID is        immutable while all other attributes are not.</li> <li><code>tagFile</code> - The name of the tag file that contains the tag. This is        a path relative to the bag root. For example, <code>bag-info.txt</code> or        <code>custom-tags/image-credits.txt</code>.</li> <li><code>tagName</code> - The name of the tag. For example, <code>Source-Organization</code>.</li> <li><code>required</code> - A boolean indicating whether the tag is required.</li> <li><code>values</code> - An option list of legal values. If this list is present        and a tag contains a value that's not in the list, the value and        the bag are invalid.</li> <li><code>defaultValue</code> - A default value assigned by the user to the tag.        DART's BagIt Profile editor allows users to specify default values        to tags that will be consistent across bags. For example, users        can define a default value to <code>Source-Organization</code> so they don't        have to assign it repeatedly every time they create a new bag.</li> <li><code>userValue</code> - The value of a tag to be written into or read from a        tag file. Users can specify a userValue that overrides the        defaultValue when they create a bag. When reading a bag, DART        assigns the actual value of a tag to what was read from the bag.</li> <li><code>isBuiltIn</code> - A boolean value indicating whether a tag definition        is built in (as opposed to user-created). DART's BagIt Profile        editor allows users to add custom tags to a published profile,        such as the APTrust profile, while preventing them from deleting        built-in tag definitions. Deleting a built-in tag definition such        as <code>Source-Organization</code> would lead to DART generating invalid bags.</li> <li><code>help</code> - Help text to describe the significance of the tag to the        user.

By default, this is set to a directory called DART inside your Documents directory. In some cases, you may want to change this. For example, if you are running out of disk space and you want to create a very large bag, you can plug in an external drive and tell DART to build new bags there.</li> <li>Control Characters in File Names describes what DART should do when it encounters control characters in file names inside of bags. Control characters include tabs, half-space Unicode characters used in Mac OS's screenshot names, and a number of other characters that are either unprintable or don't play nice with certain file systems. In some cases, these characters can prevent files from being copied to remote SFTP and S3 servers. In general, if you're copying a tar or gzip file to a remote SFTP or S3 service, you won't need to care about control characters in file names. If you're copying loose files (not tarred or gzipped), you might need to care, as these systems may reject the files because they can't properly store the file names. This setting has four options:<ul> <li>Ignore means DART should ignore the fact that some file names contain potentially invalid characters. That is, DART should just happily bag and validate them as if they will never present a problem.</li> <li>Warn means DART should bag and validate files with potentially problematic file names and warn you if it sees them. This is probably the best setting for most users, as it can tell you why a remote SFTP or S3 server won't accept them. (Again, if you're uploading tarred or gzipped bags, S3 and SFTP won't care what's inside them, so you won't see a problem.)</li> <li>Refuse to Bag means DART will not create bags if it sees problematice characters in the names of the files going into that bag. DART will also cause those bags to fail validation. Use this option if you want to root out potentially bad file names before bagging. DART will tell you which files are causing the problems.</li> <li>Fail Validation means DART will create bags with problematic file names but they will fail DART's own validation process.</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p>Note</p> <p>APTrust users should choose either Refuse to Bag or Fail Validation.

Use this option if you are running\n                 a workflow against a batch of files. If you specify a workflow\n                 file, you must also specify --batch. Workflows can be exported\n                 from the DART UI.\n\n  --batch        Path to CSV batch file. Use this option with --workflow to\n                 specify a set of files or directories to run through a\n                 workflow. The batch file format is described at\n                 https://aptrust.github.io/dart-docs/users/workflows/batch_jobs/\n\n  --output-dir   Path to package output directory. Jobs and workflows will\n                 create bags in this directory. This option is always REQUIRED.\n\n  --delete       Delete bags after job completes? Set this to true or false.\n                 The default is true for jobs and workflows that include\n                 uploads: the bags will be deleted after successful uploads.\n                 Default is false for jobs and workflows that do not include\n                 uploads because you probably want to do something with the bag\n                 after it's created.\n\n  --concurrency  Number of jobs to run concurrently. Default is 1. Max value\n                 for this param should be less than or equal to the number of\n                 processors on your machine. You may get diminishing returns\n                 when setting this above 2 because most of the DART runner's\n                 work is reading from and writing to disk. This setting only\n                 makes sense for workflows. For a single job, you can omit\n                 this.\n\n  --skip-artifacts  Don't save artifacts (tag files and manifests) to a\n                 separate directory when creating bags. (Version 1.0 and\n                 higher only)\n\n  --help         Show this help document.\n</code></pre>"},{"location":"runner/#examples","title":"Examples","text":"<p>If you're running a single job, you can send job params to dart-runner through STDIN, like this:</p> <pre><code>echo '{ json }' | dart-runner --workflow=workflow.json --output-dir=/dir\n</code></pre> <p>The job params json tells dart-runner which files to bag and what tag values to set.
