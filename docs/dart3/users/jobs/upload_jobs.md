# Upload-Only Jobs

!!! note
    This document describes upload-only jobs that do not involve bagging.
    For information about uploading as part of the bagging process, see
    [Uploading](upload.md)

Upload-only jobs allow you to upload files that already exist. You may want to upload files created outside of DART, or upload DART bags that failed to upload on a previous attempt.

Follow these steps to upload files from DART:

1. Choose **Jobs > Upload Files** from the top menu.

1. On the files page, drag files and folders you want to upload from the left side of the screen into the drop zone on the right side. By default, DART shows the files and folders in your DART bagging directory. Use the jump menu above the files list to go to a different folder if needed.
