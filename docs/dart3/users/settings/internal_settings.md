# Internal Settings

Internal Settings contain configuration information that users cannot edit. These settings are created by plugins, settings imports, and software updates. Though you cannot change them, knowing their values may be helpful to DART users and developers.

While DART 2 came with a number of internal settings, DART 3 may have none on its initial release. Internal settings may appear over time as DART 3 adds new features.
