This group will primarily be a [mailing list](https://groups.google.com/a/aptrust.org/g/dart-users), where users can share experiences, ask questions, and support one another. Depending on the level of interest and engagement, we may expand this initiative to include regular virtual meetings and more structured activities in the future.
