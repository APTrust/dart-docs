# Building DART

Once you've cloned the [DART source code from GitHub](https://github.com/APTrust/dart), there are two ways to build the application.

1. `cd` into the DART project directory and run the command `./node_modules/.bin/electron-builder`. This will run a command-line build for your platform.

1. `cd` into the DART project directory and run the command `npm run electron-toolkit`. This will present a GUI that makes it easy to customize your build and to build DART for other platforms.
