# Documenting DART

If you contribute code to DART, please document it for the sanity of the people who will maintain it. DART uses [JSDoc](https://jsdoc.app/) to generate the [DART API documentation](https://aptrust.github.io/dart/). Look at the source code for examples of how we use JSDoc.

In addition to documenting your API methods, you should comment sections of your code in which the logic or behavior is not obvious.

violent psychopath who knows where you live. -- [John F. Woods](https://groups.google.com/forum/#!msg/comp.lang.c++/rYCO5yn4lXw/oITtSkZOtoUJ)
