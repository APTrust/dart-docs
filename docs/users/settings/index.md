# Settings

DART includes the following settings:

[App Settings](app_settings.md) include information such as your organization name (used when creating bags) and your default output directory (to which bags are written).

[Internal Settings](internal_settings.md) are read-only settings that you may occasionally need to examine when tracing problems.

[Remote Repositories](remote_repositories.md) describe how to connect to remote preservation repositories that ingest the materials you upload.

[Storage Services](storage_services.md) describe how to connect to drop-off and pick up points, such as S3 buckets or FTP services. These are usually temporary storage points used to drop off materials for ingest or to pick up items restored by a preservation repository.
